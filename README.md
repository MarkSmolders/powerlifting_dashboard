<img src="images\powerlifting_logo.png" height="200px" align="right"/>

Interactive data-driven dashboard for powerlifters: predict your meet totals with Machine Learning, analyse lift ratios to detect potential weakpoints, and optimize weight class selection for maximal GL Points.
<br>
<br>
## Features
- **Total Predictor**: ML-based predictions for your next competition total using historical performance, training age, and demographics
- **Lift Ratio Analyzer**: Identify strength imbalances by comparing your squat/bench/deadlift ratios to percentile distributions
- **Weight Class Optimizer**: Find your optimal competitive weight class using Wilks/DOTS calculations and competitive landscape analysis
- **Progress Tracker**: Visualize your historical progression and compare against predictions
